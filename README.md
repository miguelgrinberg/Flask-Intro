Flask-Intro
===========

Sample code from my "Introduction to Flask" presentation.

Requirements
------------

- Flask (`pip install flask`) is required for all the examples.
- Flask-Bootstrap (`pip install flask-bootstrap`) is required for examples 4 and up.
- Flask-WTF (`pip install flask-wtf`) is required for examples 5 and up.

Installation
------------

You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages with the following commands:

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Examples
--------------------

With the virtual environment activated you can `cd` into any of the examples and run the main script.

For examples 1-6:

    (venv) $ python hello.py

For example 7:

    (venv) $ python manage.py
